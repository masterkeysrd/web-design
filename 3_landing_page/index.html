            <h2>SKATE TYPES</h2>
            <h4>FITNESS SKATES</h4>
            <p>
              Modern inline skates were originally designed for fitness training for
              ice hockey players, by ice hockey players. Today, fitness skates are
              designed specifically for those individuals who seek to utilize their
              skates for getting in shape, or skating very frequently. In a
              nutshell, fitness skates are high performance recreational skates

            </div>
            <h4>URBAN SKATES</h4>
            <p>
              In recent years, a new skate type has gained in popularity. Urban
              skates, also referred to as Street skates, are essentially a hybrid of
              Recreational and Aggressive style skates.

          <h2 class="mb-3">BENEFITS OF INLINE SKATING</h2>
          <h4>IMPROVES DYNAMIC BALANCE, COORDINATION, & AGILITY</h4>
          <p>
            Inline skating is about dynamic balance, or balance while your body
            is in motion. By starting with the basic inline skating skills then
            learning to do more advanced moves on your skates, such as skating
            backwards, crossover turns, inline hockey, aggressive skating, and
            even yoga, you can challenge your balance, coordination, and
            agility.
          </p>
          <h4>INCREASES CORE STRENGTH</h4>
          <p>
            Postural, abdominal, and back extensor muscles, get a great workout
            while inline skating. With each push and glide motion, the core is
            activated to support the whole body providing stability allowing for
            dynamic balance. A strong core contributes to the effortless look a
            practiced skater demonstrates.
          </p>
          <h4>WEIGHT LOSS AND MAINTENANCE</h4>
          <p>
            Inline skating at 10mph on a regular basis not only burns about 6
            calories a minute, or 360 calories an hour, but also turns fat into
            muscle - a double benefit. Also, the faster you skate, the more
            calories youâ€™ll burn per minute.
          </p>
          <h4>LOW IMPACT EXERCISE</h4>
          <p>
            While skating has the bone density enhancing benefits of being a
            weight bearing activity, the smooth push and glide motion has
            minimal impact on the joints.
          </p>
          <h4>INCREASES SELF-CONFIDENCE</h4>
          <p>
            Probably the greatest fitness benefit of all is that inline skating
            is fun and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you tackle new
            fitness challenges. There are so many great inline skate events
            around the country in which to participate; from races to tours to
            local skate nights to so much more. Get out there and have fun
            getting and staying fit!
