          One Piece (stylized as ONE PIECE) is a Japanese manga series written
          and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's
          Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since July 1997, with its individual
          chapters compiled into 97 tankōbon volumes as of September 2020. The
          story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
          gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil
          Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy
          explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure
          known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.
          In August 2020, it was announced that One Piece was approaching its
          final arc.

          The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a
          festival film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series produced
          by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999.
          Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one
          original video animation and thirteen television specials. Several
          companies have developed various types of merchandising and media,
          such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series
          was licensed for an English language release in North America and the
          United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.
          The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an
          English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license
          was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
